Libraries used are ;

os: For file and directory operations.

keras and tensorflow.keras: For neural network model creation, training, and callbacks (like TensorBoard and EarlyStopping).

utils: Assumed to be a custom module for loading data, splitting data, and creating the model.

pyaudio: For recording audio from the microphone.

wave: For handling WAV audio files.

librosa: For audio analysis and feature extraction (e.g., MFCC, chroma).

numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.

sys (specifically, byteorder): For handling system-specific byte order information.

array: For creating arrays of audio data in specific formats.

struct: For packing and unpacking binary data.

tkinter: For creating GUI dialogs, message boxes, and file dialogs.

PIL (Pillow): For image manipulation and drawing text on images.

playsound: For playing audio files.

threading: For running tasks in parallel (e.g., playing audio).

pandas: For handling data in tabular form (CSV files).

tqdm: For showing progress bars.

sklearn.model_selection: For splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets.

keras.Sequential and tensorflow.keras.layers: For building the neural network with layers like Dense, LSTM, and Dropout.
